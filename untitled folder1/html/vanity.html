              <h2>VANITY<br/></h2>
              <p>In an ancient and mysterious world, people worshipped a god named Alec, a beautiful man with wings, the spine of a sheep, and the tail of a scorpion. Considered the embodiment of supernatural forces, Alek was seen as a divine being, a bridge between humanity and mystical forces, and his presence symbolized beauty, balance, and transformation. However, behind this cult lies a dark and sinister truth. Alek is a highly deceptive being who exploits people's beliefs and worship to gain power and control. He presented himself as peaceful, luminous and transformative, and with the help of his supernatural powers, he showed the healing of disease, the relief of natural disasters and the enlightenment of the human heart. In fact, Alec's power was not derived from mystical forces, but from dark evil forces, who used people's faith to corrupt and enslave their minds, using worship and sacrifice to lure them to borrow the power of God and sacrifice their souls. Alek's true form is that of a fallen evil god whose wings, the spine of a sheep, and the tail of a scorpion are symbols of his evil nature.</p>
