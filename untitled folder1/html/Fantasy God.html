            <h2>Fantasy God<br/></h2>
            <p>Fantasy Gods is a series of photographs that use the language of fashion to explore the idea of giving material form to deities. It also builds on the idea that gods are appeared and envisioned by human beings, often in answer to human faith and needs. With that in mind I set about inventing my own gods entirely from my imagination, but giving them visual form through stylish garments, special makeup, and props that are often handmade.</p>

<p>The inspiration for my concept of God stems from the depths of my imagination, where various deities are depicted in unique and diverse ways. They come from the universe, nature and heroic figures in disasters. Select specific themes from these sources for detailed analysis, and then find or make fashion styling, makeup and props that match the imagination in my mind. To further enhance the synergy between each shooting theme and its corresponding visual representation, I employ on-site lighting design and adjustments to ensure optimal harmony with the overall composition. For instance, for the snake shoot I made the fashion look that I want through the shape, color and pattern of the snake to achieve the effect of the mysterious snake lady figure with the black background and the concentrated light effect.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this work is to present my creation and imagination, so that the abstract word God can be symbolized through photography, and the audience can think about the image of God.
